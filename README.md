# Prework Study guide 

## Description

This is the project study guide that I have written with the help of the instructions found on the prework modules. I have followed through with it in order to learn front-end development with the hope of one day working in IT. I wish to work in IT because it is a secure working field which would allow me a better standard of living in the future.
